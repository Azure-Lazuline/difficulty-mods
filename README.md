# difficulty-mods

![](https://github.com/Azure-Lazuline/difficulty-mods/blob/main/screenshots/screen1.png?raw=true)

A set of adjustable difficulty options for CrossCode. Turn up enemy damage or HP, or turn down healing or EXP gain. You can do this at any time from the options menu, so mess with it depending on how you're feeling at the moment to get it just right!

- **Received Damage** - already available as a New Game Plus option, but this means you don't have to commit for a whole run, and it's more granular.
- **Enemy HP** - feel like things die too quick when you're fully-equipped? Try this!
- **Healing** - affects all in-combat healing, including sandwiches, regen, and even Arena between-round heals.
- **EXP Gain** - useful for 100% runs so you don't get too overpowered from the sidequests.

### Installation

To use, install [ccloader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader) and then put [the .ccmod file](https://github.com/Azure-Lazuline/difficulty-mods/releases) in your mods folder.
