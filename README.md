A set of adjustable difficulty options for CrossCode. Turn up enemy damage or HP, or turn down healing or EXP gain. You can do this at any time from the options menu, so mess with it depending on how you're feeling at the moment to get it just right!

To use, install [ccloader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader) and then put [the .ccmod file](https://github.com/Azure-Lazuline/difficulty-mods/releases) in your mods folder.
